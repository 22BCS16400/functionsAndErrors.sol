This course teaches us how to build decentralized applications (Dapps) on the Ethereum blockchain and Avalanche using the Solidity programming language. The course teaches how to create smart contracts, connect them to wallets, build a user interface, and deploy your Dapps.
In this course, Ethereum developers can build innovative, decentralized applications capable of smart contract automation and peer-to-peer payment facilitation.
Goal of Avax :  Avalanche (AVAX) is a multi-faceted blockchain platform designed to address the core challenges of scalability, security, and decentralization in the blockchain ecosystem.
